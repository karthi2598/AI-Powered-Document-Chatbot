Title: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. These systems are designed to think, learn, and adapt to solve problems and make decisions.

Applications of AI:
1. Natural Language Processing (e.g., Chatbots)
2. Computer Vision (e.g., Facial Recognition)
3. Robotics (e.g., Self-driving Cars)
4. Predictive Analytics (e.g., Fraud Detection)

Challenges of AI include ethical concerns, job displacement, and data privacy issues.

Conclusion:
AI continues to evolve, impacting industries from healthcare to finance, and reshaping the future of technology.
